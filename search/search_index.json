Start by opening a terminal in your new-go-project directory</p> <p>B. Make sure you are working in your dev container! </p> <p>Hint</p> <p>You can check your dev container status by looking at the bright blue rectangle at the bottom left corner of your screen. If you are connected, it should say \"Dev Container: New Go Project...\".</p> <p>C. Enable dependency tracking for your code with a go.mod file by running the <code>go mod init</code> command, giving it the name, or path, of the module your code will be in. In this case, the path will be that of the the directory <code>new-go-project</code> where your source code is kept. The command should look like:</p> <p><code>go mod init new-go-project</code></p> <p>Why the go mod command?</p> <p>When your code imports packages contained in other modules, you manage those dependencies through your code's own module, which is defined by a <code>go.mod</code> file that tracks the modules that provide those packages. This file stays with your code, including in the source code repository. The <code>go mod</code> command essentially tells Go that this is a Go module, and the <code>go.mod</code> file will contain the name of the module and what version of Go was used to build it. </p> <p>D. In your project directory in VSCode, create a file <code>hello.go</code> in which you will write your code</p> <p>E. Paste the following code into the <code>hello.go</code> file and save the file:  <pre><code>package main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(\"Hello COMP423\")\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>How does this work?</p> <ul> <li>Declare a main package, which is a way to group functions and is made up of all the files in directory.</li> <li>The fmt package contains functions for formatting text, including printing to the console.</li> <li>Implement a main function to print a message to the console. This will execute by default when you run the main package. </li> </ul> <p>F. Go back to your terminal and enter the </p> <p>G. Now you can run your code with the following command:</p> <pre><code>go run hello.go \n</code></pre> <p>This should output <code>Hello COMP423</code> in your terminal!</p> <p>H. In cases where you want to compile your code for testing, but do not want to execute the code, you can run <code>go build</code>to compile the source code into an executable binary. This command is different from <code>go run</code> as it does not execute the program. </p> <p>Tip</p> <p>For best practice, run <code>go mod tidy</code> to clean up unused dependencies before building</p> <p>Note</p> <p>If you do not provide an argument to the <code>go build</code> command, it will automatically compile the program in your current directory and include all <code>.go</code> files in the directory. In the case of this tutorial, the command will product an executable file named <code>new-go-project</code>. Go automatically decides the name of the generated executable by using the module created earlier with <code>go mod init</code>. If you want to specify the name of output file: <code>go build -o insertname</code>. If you want to compile only <code>hello.go</code>, run <code>go build hello.go</code></p> <ul> <li>Now that you have created an executable, run <code>./new-go-project</code>. The output of the binary should match the output from when you ran the program with <code>go run hello.go</code>: <code>Hello COMP423</code></li> </ul> <p>I. Now, all that's left to do is commit and push your changes to your github repository! </p> <pre><code>    git add . \n    git commit -m \"Hello COMP423\"\n    git push origin main\n</code></pre> <p>Tip</p> <p>The go commands covered in this tutorial are few of many go commands you can use to get things done with Go. You can use <code>go help</code> to get a list of the others!</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/go-setup/#sources","title":"Sources:","text":"<ul> <li>Go Tutorial</li> <li>How To Build and Install Go Programs</li> </ul>"}]}
